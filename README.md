### Algorithmic-Auctions

This repository contains the code and report made on Algorithmic Competition in Industrial Organization and Structural Economics course. The project studied the possibility of algorithmic collusion in markets and auctions when firms take actions through reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, DQN). This project also studied alternative market designs that could limit collusion.

#### Auction Design and Algorithmic Learning

Research Question:

Are first price auctions more efficient than second price auctions under algorithmic learning?

Contribution:

I conduct a randomised experiment where self-learning algorithms bid in repeated auctions. By controlling for extraneous factors, I isolate the impact of auction design on efficiency after the learning process.

Research Answer:

Moving from a first price auction to a second price auction improves auction efficiency and limits bid suppression, even after controlling for extraneous factors.

Importance:

The study suggests that first price auctions like Google Ad Exchange may be at risk for bid suppression as more self-learning algorithms participate in bidding.
