# AlgorithmicCollusion

This repository contains the code and report made on Algorithmic Competition in Industrial Organization and Structural Economics course. The project studied the possibility of algorithmic collusion in markets and auctions when firms take actions through reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, DQN). This project also studied alternative market designs that could limit collusion.
