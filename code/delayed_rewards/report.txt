Research Question: Is algorithmic collusion possible in multi-period auctions? What kind of market design can eliminate this? 


Experimental setup: common valuation and so collusion is when winning bid is below valuation (index 4). 

Exp1: Single q-learner + FPA + copycat -> agent learns to play optimally.
Exp2: Single q-learner + SPA + copycat -> agent learns to play optimally. 
Exp3: Single q-learner + FPA + smart copycat -> agent learns to play optimally.
Exp4: Single q-learner + FPA + smart copycat -> agent learns to play optimally.
Exp5: Double q-learner + FPA -> collusion 3/4
Exp6: Double q-learner + SPA -> no collusion 
Exp7: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal winning bid -> collusion 3/4
Exp8: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal winning bid -> no collusion 
Exp9: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal winning bid + discounting -> 
Exp10: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal winning bid + discounting -> 
Exp11: Double q-learner + FPA + very delayed ->  
Exp12: Double q-learner + SPA + very delayed -> 
Exp11: Double q-learner + FPA + very delayed + discounting -> 
Exp12: Double q-learner + SPA + very delayed + discounting -> 
Exp13: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal winning bid + very delayed -> 
Exp14: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal winning bid + very delayed -> 
Exp15: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal winning bid + very delayed + discounting ->   
Exp16: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal winning bid + very delayed + discounting -> 
Exp17: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal oppn max bid -> 
Exp18: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal oppn max bid -> 
Exp19: Double q-learner + FPA + reveal oppn max bid + discounting-> 
Exp20: Double q-learner + SPA + reveal oppn max bid + discounting-> 
Exp21: Double q-learner + immediate FPA -> collusion
Exp22: Double q-learner + immediate SPA -> no collusion
Exp23: Double q-learner + immediate FPA + reveal winning bid -> collusion 3/4
Exp24: Double q-learner + immediate SPA + reveal winning bid -> no collusion
Exp25: Double q-learner + immediate FPA + reveal winning bid + discounting -> collusion 0/4
Exp26: Double q-learner + immediate SPA + reveal winning bid + discounting -> no collusion
Exp27: Double q-learner + SPA + high granularity ->
